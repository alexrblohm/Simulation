#Simulation HW 1
1. Chapter 3, Exercise 2 
Let h(x,n) = 1+x+x2 +···+
```{r}
#for n = 0
#h(x,0) = 1

#for n=1
#h(x, 1)= 1 + x

#for n = 2
#h(x, 2)= 1 + x + x^2
n=10
h=1
x=2
for (i in 1:n){
  h <- h + x^i
  #print(h)
}

print(h)
```

2. Chapter 3, Exercise 7 
How would you find the sum of every third element of a vector x?
```{r}
library(dplyr)
#x <- c(1,2,3,4,5,6,7)

x[seq(1, length(x), by = 3)] %>%
  sum()
```
